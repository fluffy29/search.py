Generates a random list of N integers (specified as a command-line argument) within the range 0 to 2*N-1.


Sorts the generated list using the built-in sort() method.


Implements a binary search function to find a randomly chosen target value within the sorted list.


Measures the execution time of the binary search using time.monotonic_ns() for high-precision timing.


Reports whether the target was found and its index in the list, or indicates if it wasn't found.


Prints the entire sorted list for reference
